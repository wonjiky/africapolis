    "description": "Namibia is Africa's least densely populated country with an average of just 3 inhabitants per square km. The country consists mainly of high plateau which is flanked by the Namib desert along the Western coastline and the Kalahari Desert to the East, rendering large swaths of the country unfavorable to human occupation. Whilst the urban population has more than doubled since 1990, the rate of urbanization has slowed down in the past decade compared to previous decades, mainly as a result of the limited demographic resources of Namibia's sparsely populated hinterland.    The country is subdivided into 14 regions and 121 constituencies and counts 17 cities with a population above 10,000 ‚Äö√Ñ√∂  the biggest being the capital Windhoek with just under 360,000 inhabitants. Most of the other larger urban agglomerations such as Rundu, Walvis Bay, Oshakati and Swakopmund are situated on the country's borders which magnifies the relative ‚Äö√Ñ√∂ 'emptiness' of the interior parts of the country. The overall urbanization rate stands at 40.3%.   Contrary to most African nations, there are few agglomerations below 20,000 inhabitants and 13 out of the 17 cities have populations between 20,000 and 40,000. Whilst the distance between urban agglomerations has gradually decreased as more cities emerge and existing cities grow, the average distance between cities remains high by African standards at 107 km.

    "description": "Namibia is Africa's least densely populated country with an average of just 3 inhabitants per square km. The country consists mainly of high plateau which is flanked by the Namib desert along the Western coastline and the Kalahari Desert to the East, rendering large swaths of the country unfavorable to human occupation. Whilst the urban population has more than doubled since 1990, the rate of urbanization has slowed down in the past decade compared to previous decades, mainly as a result of the limited demographic resources of Namibia's sparsely populated hinterland.    The country is subdivided into 14 regions and 121 constituencies and counts 17 cities with a population above 10,000 ‚Äö√Ñ√∂  the biggest being the capital Windhoek with just under 360,000 inhabitants. Most of the other larger urban agglomerations such as Rundu, Walvis Bay, Oshakati and Swakopmund are situated on the country's borders which magnifies the relative ‚Äö√Ñ√∂ 'emptiness' of the interior parts of the country. The overall urbanization rate stands at 40.3%.   Contrary to most African nations, there are few agglomerations below 20,000 inhabitants and 13 out of the 17 cities have populations between 20,000 and 40,000.
